# AutoZing (NSWI141)

## About

### Purpose
Autozing is a mockup car retnal website created as a part of my Introduction to Networking class (NSWI141).
I was only allowed to use pure HTML and CSS with certain restrictions. The project took about a week to finish.

### Additions
The site is not responsive as of January 2023.
